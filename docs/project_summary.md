**Serious Social** is a Farcaster mini-app that asks a simple question: *What would you lock your money behind?*

In a world where opinions cost nothing to broadcast, this project creates **Belief Markets** — spaces where conviction is measured not by volume or virality, but by *escrowed seriousness*. Stake USDC on a claim. Let it rest. The longer it stays, the louder it speaks.

```
    SUPPORT ████████████░░░░ 72%
    OPPOSE  ████░░░░░░░░░░░░ 28%

    Time makes the signal.
    Patience writes the score.
```

**The paradox**: Nothing is wagered. No one loses. Both sides earn rewards for their commitment. Yet the act of locking capital — even temporarily — transforms cheap talk into costly signal. The 5% early-exit fee isn't punishment; it's the price of impatience in a system that worships time.

## Built With

- **Next.js 15 & React 19** — the frame and the canvas
- **Farcaster SDK** — the social substrate
- **Base blockchain** — where commitments become permanent
- **Upstash Redis** — memory that persists between conversations
- **Time-weighted mathematics** — where `t × P - S` becomes philosophy

## The Philosophy

This is infrastructure for **serious discourse** — not prediction markets that resolve to truth or falsehood, but belief markets that reveal *who cared enough to wait*. The Unchallenged badge isn't a victory; it's an invitation. Silence is data. Patience is power.

In the attention economy's cacophony, Serious Social whispers:

*Put your money where your mouth is.*
*Then wait.*
*The waiting is the point.*
